# Parallel Programming for GPUs - Matrix Multiplication

Dense Matrix Multiplication (DMM) is one of the core components in many scientific computations. In this repository, we implement the DMM algorithm for GPUs in 4 ways, increasing each time the total performance. 


## Algorithms
 - Naive
 - Coalesced memory acceses of A
 - Reduced memory accesses
 - Using cuBLAS


## Brief results
